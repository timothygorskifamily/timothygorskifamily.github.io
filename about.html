      <h2>Who We Are</h2>
      <p>
        The Gorski Foundation is a Christian philanthropic organization run by the Gorski Family Office. Our focus is on supporting evangelical organizations both in the United States and abroad. We believe in the power of faith-based initiatives to transform lives and communities, and we are committed to providing resources, encouragement, and support to those on the frontlines.
